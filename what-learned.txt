1. The callback function have action obj. There are a type property. we need
to switch this property. and we need to return new state based on this property.

===============>
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT":
            return {count: state.count + 1};
        case "DECREMENT":
            return {count: state.count - 1};
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

2. when call this dispatch method. Then we give a obj as arg. There are type property
we will write the type on this property.

const ReducerCount = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>This is Reducer Count: {state.count}</h1>
            <button onClick={()=>dispatch({type:"INCREMENT"})}>increment</button>
            <button onClick={()=>dispatch({type:"DECREMENT"})}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    );
};
